#Introduction

*This problem can be accessed at [HackerRank] (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/sock-merchant/problem?h_l=interview&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=interview-preparation-kit&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=warmup, "Practice")*

## Problem

Alex works at a clothing store. There is a large pile of socks that must be paired by color for sale. Given an array of integers representing the color of each sock, determine how many pairs of socks with matching colors there are.

For example, there are n = 7 socks with colors ar = [1,2,1,2,1,3,2]. There is one pair of color  and one of color . There are three odd socks left, one of each color. The number of pairs is 2.

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer n, the number of socks represented in ar.
The second line contains n space-separated integers describing the colors ar[i] of hte socks in the pile.

## Sample Input

n = 9
ar = [10,20,20,10,10,30,50,10,20]

## Sample Output

3

This little project is part of a repository of HackerRank Interview Practice Questions. For this solution
we take an approach towards the problem by utilizing HashSets to store the individual sock color counts.
